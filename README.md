# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The developed app is an inventory management tool that tracks and manages inventory levels. It incorporates an authentication feature that requires a user to log in using a unique user ID and password to ensure only authorized users can make changes to the inventory database. Once logged in, users can easily add, remove, increase, or decrease items from the inventory database. Additionally, a notification feature is included that alerts users when inventory levels fall below a certain threshold. The inventory data is presented in a grid view format for ease of use.
# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The app consists of four main screens: a login screen, an inventory grid view display screen, a settings and notification screen, and an item addition screen flow. The UI was designed with the user in mind, using a color scheme of greens and blues that were consistent across all screens to create a seamless flow between each screen. Careful attention was paid to ensure that the screens were not confusing or misleading to the user. The app was successful in its function and met the standards outlined in the Android Core Application Quality document, making it a successful first-time app development project.
# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
During the development of this app, I initially had big plans and attempted to include too many features. However, this approach ended up slowing me down in the development process and ultimately led to a scrapping the original app with more planned features than actual functional components. Going forward, I learned from this mistake and shifted my approach to first focus on building a functional core app, then incrementally add features such as the notification system and menu. Moving forward, I recognize the importance of starting with a solid foundation and building upon it in a step-by-step manner during the development process.
# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
In order to verify the functionality and performance of my code, I conducted testing on various emulated devices within the Android IDK, including devices with different screen sizes such as various pixel devices and tablets. This testing was crucial because although a developer may have a specific device in mind during the development process, end-users may use the application on a wide range of devices. It is essential to ensure that the app functions properly and seamlessly on all supported devices to provide the best possible user experience.
# Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
At first, I faced challenges in bringing all the different components of the app together. Specifically, I encountered difficulties in integrating the notification screen with the menu and struggled with connecting the radio button. To overcome these challenges, I sought out online tutorials and used them as a reference to create the necessary connections and switches required to achieve full functionality of the app.
# In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I found the process of creating the login authentication screen to be particularly enjoyable. In addition, I have a keen interest in working with various SQL database technologies, such as mySQL and noSQL, and am excited to explore the integration of different programming languages with database systems. I also enjoyed the UI/UX design portion of the app.
